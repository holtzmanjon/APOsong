guider module
*************

The guider module is a client that handles guiding the telescope
based on continually taking images with a guide camera, and keeping
the position of an object at the same location on the detector.

Currently, it is designed to acquire and guide on the brightest
object in the (small) guider field of view. The exposure time
is automatically adjusted to provide desired count level.

The centering algorithm is designed to work even if the object
is positioned over an aperture where light is lost, e.g., down
a fiber. This is accomplished using an algorithm developed for
SDSS, where the center of an object is defined as the location
at which the variance of counts in a series of circular annulie
is minimized, where pixels in the aperture are masked out and
not included in the variance calculation.

Guiding is implemented with a PI loop, with adjustible proportional
and integral constants. The guiding corrections are measured
from each exposure, but are averaged over series of shorter
exposures before a correction is applied.

A minimum number of counts is required to determine a correction.
