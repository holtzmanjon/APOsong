guider module
*************

The guider module is a client that handles guiding the telescope
based on continually taking images with a guide camera, and keeping
the position of an object at the same location on the detector.

Currently, it is designed to acquire and guide on the brightest
object in the (small) guider field of view. The exposure time
is automatically adjusted to provide desired count level.

The centering algorithm is designed to work even if the object
is positioned over an aperture where light is lost, e.g., down
a fiber. This is accomplished using an algorithm developed for
SDSS, where the center of an object is defined as the location
at which the variance of counts in a series of circular annuli
is minimized, where pixels in the aperture are masked out and
not included in the variance calculation.

Guiding is implemented with a PI loop, with adjustible proportional
and integral constants. The guiding corrections are measured
from each exposure, but are averaged over series of shorter
exposures before a correction is applied.

A minimum number of counts is required to determine a correction.

The module defines a Guider object which can be instantiated and
has multiple methods. Basic sequence is to first instantiate it with a
desired position; this can be the fiber hole, and an accurate position
for the hole can be automatically determined using a calibration
channel image. Then the object is acquired; the brightest object
is found and then moved to the desired position. Guiding then
repeats calling the guide() method, which determines offset, and
makes corrections based on parameter of the Guider object (exptime,
number of frames to average, number of corrections to average before
applying offset, PI proportionality constants, etc.

The main() method listens for comands on localhost port 5000. The
commands can be one of start, stop, pause, or resume. The start
command can take keywords to set parameters of the Guider object.
