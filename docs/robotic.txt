robotic module
**************

robotic module provides a client for robotic operation of the APO SONG telescope.
It uses the routine and Alpyca devices of the aposong module to execute observatory,
telescope and camera control.

Once SONG operation starts, robotic observing will be driven by the conductor at
Aarhus University, but this has not yet been implemented.

In the meantime, an independent robotic observer has been developer; it seems likely
that some of the pieces will be of use with the SONG operations.

The main function is observe(). This will wait until a specified time relative
to sunset to open the dome, and then wait until a specified time relative to nautical
twilight to start observing. Observing continues in a loop until a specified time
relative to morning twilight. Safety status is checked in between each object to
determine whether to suspend operations until it becomes safe again; note that
the dome closes independently immediately on unsafe conditions through the
Dome server.

Observations are drawn from a Postgres robotic schema that includes a 
database table (requests) that gives a target (defined in target table), observing schedule
constraints (defined in schedule table) , and observing sequence
(defined in squence table). The getbest() routine selects the best
object to observed given the constraints and lenght of boserving
sequence based on either a criterion to observe objects before they
set (default), or to observe objects that will be available for the
longest amount of time.

Once an object is select, it is acquired, guiding started, and then the
exposure sequence executed. Completed sequences are logged back into the Postgres
database in the observed table.

The contents of the database tables is shown below:

Calibration sequences can also be obtained automatically.

At the end of the night, web pages, focus curves, and guider movies for the
night are constructed.
