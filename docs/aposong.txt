aposong module
**************

Introduction
++++++++++++

aposong provides a Python interface to the observing system for the SONG node at Apache
Point Observatory. It communicates with devices attached to other computers on the
internal APO network: the Planewave 1m telescope, the Planewave mirror covers,
the focal plane camera on the telescope, the dome, a safety monitor that checks
status of other telescopes on site, and, eventually, a spectrograph camera.

Communication with these devices is achieved, for the most part, using the
ASCOM/Alpaca protocol, although a few more specialized commands are communicated
through non-standard interfaces. 

The main module, aposong, opens up an Alpaca device for each of the devices. It
provides routines for many basic observatory tasks, e.g., opening and closing,
slewing, taking exposures, etc., coordinating commands to different devices
as needed. Individual devices can also be addressed using the Alpaca device
instantiations and the standard ASCOM command sets for more experienced users
if needed.

To run the software, start an ipython session on the song1m

.. code-block:: 

    from aposong import *

This should open a status window that reports information from telescope, dome,
and camera(s), and also open a pyvista display window into which images can
be automatically displayed as they are obtained. Otherwise, you get a normal
python interface, but with a set of observatory commands now defined.

Information about individual commands and parameters is best obtained through
the docstrings, available below or using interactive help when running the
Python interface, but a summary of commands is:

Observatory commands:
  - open(): open dome, mirror covers
  - close(): close mirror covers, dome, and park

Dome commands:
  - domehome(): move dome to home position

Telescope commands :
  - slew(ra,dec): slew to coordinates
  - offset(ra,dec): offset telescope
  - usno([ra,dec]) : find/slew to USNO A2.0 star
  - altaz(az,alt): slew to az/alt coordinates
  - foc(focus) : set focus to specified value
  - tracking(True|False): turn tracking on/off
  - mirror_covers(True|False): control mirror covers
  - park(): park telescope and dome

Camera commands :
  - expose(exptime,filt,**kwargs: take an exposure
  - focrun(cent,step,nsteps,exptime,filt,**kwargs): take series of exposures at different focus positions
  - settemp(temp): set camera temperature set point
  - cooler(state): set camera cooler state on (True) or off (False)
